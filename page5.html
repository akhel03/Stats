     <h2>Lab Reflection</h2>

  <p>
    Reason For Choosing Lab: I chose the chapter eleven lab on chi-square since I did not use my calculator that much. I only used my calculator to calculate the expected values, observed values, test statistic, and the p-value. I was able to explain what the null and alternative hypotheses are without using the calculator. The null hypothesis was described in the problem and the alternative hypothesis was the opposite of the null hypothesis. However to conclude if the evidence rejects the null hypothesis or it is either a failure depends on the p-value I calculated from my calculator. 
  <br><br>
    Reflection: What I learned from problems one through seven was to explain the null and alternative hypotheses, deciding if the null hypothesis is rejected or a failure, and finding the p-value by using the test of good fit. These were things I learned from the previous chapters nine through ten except that the p-value was calculated differently depending on the formula and the context of the problem. Learning these things did help me get through chapter eleven. Additionally, I learned to analyze the data from doing the problems. Analyzing is a crucial part for interpreting and organizing data.
