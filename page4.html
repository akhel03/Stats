    <h2>Use of Statistics</h2>

    Reason For Choosing Video: I chose this video about comparing and contrasting qualitative and quantitative data because Organic Chemistry Tutor explains it in six minutes with a couple of examples. Watching longer videos tends to take longer for me to understand math concepts. Also, Organic Chemistry Tutor does not only provide tutorial videos related to statistics, he provides other tutorial videos for courses related to chemistry, physics, and other math courses such as calculus, algebra, and trigonometry. I discovered him during the time I was taking AP Calculus AB in high school. His tutorial videos did help me get by in AP Calculus AB.

Reflection: What I have learned in the first few chapters in the course were things that I already knew which were the mean, mode, median, range, box plots, and some basic probability from my previous math classes, and the types of data, sampling methods, statistics definitions, and types of studies from AP Psychology. The rest of the chapters are new concepts that I never knew about. It was interesting to learn  how statistics can be used in real life applications more than calculus. Statistics is more suited for business majors and jobs that involve data. I think of calculus for people majoring in STEM.
